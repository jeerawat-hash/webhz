## Trobleshooting

- curl: (60) SSL certificate : unable to get local issuer certificate

This error commonly found in local server, read how to fix it on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31830614).

- Other SSL/TLS problem

Check your cURL version and openssl extension. If they're old or not enable yet, please fix it.

- Login successful but can't get any data from APIs.

Make sure your script can write cookie.txt, chmod 755 to fix it.

- Can't login even enter right username/password

If you failed too many attempt to login, your account might get banned. You have to contact True Wallet support directly for further assistance.

## Milestones

- Add shortcut functions to easier get data.
- Format codes and create a composer package.
- Create full functional system.
